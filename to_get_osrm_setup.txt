To get these (perhaps download in background as this will take at least an hour):
>Install Docker Desktop on your Mac (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ -> Mac with intel chip)
Open it, check it opens, then close the box. You should see a whale icon on the top right of the Mac screen
>Click on the Whale icon, go to preferences -> Resources -> Change memory allocated to 10Gb and ‘apply and restart’ (if you don’t do this the roadmap extraction in the next step will fail silently as OSRM runs out of RAM)
>Download OSRM image from docker, then download UK road network and process it to work with OSRM. Open Terminal and:

(make and change directory to a folder you want to store data in)

docker pull osrm/osrm-backend
curl -o great-britain-latest.osm.pbf http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain-latest.osm.pbf
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua  /data/great-britain-latest.osm.pbf
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/great-britain-latest.osrm
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/great-britain-latest.osrm
docker run --rm -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/great-britain-latest.osrm

This should now be queryable on your local machine, try putting this test query into a chrome URL (London to Birmingham):
http://0.0.0.0:5000/route/v1/driving/0.1278,51.5074;1.8904,52.4862?overview=false

Which should return this json text:
{"code":"Ok","routes":[{"legs":[{"steps":[],"distance":195965.8,"duration":9411.4,"summary":"","weight":9411.4}],"distance":195965.8,"duration":9411.4,"weight_name":"routability","weight":9411.4}],"waypoints":[{"hint":"IZUlgKjVA4AAAAAAJQAAACwAAAAAAAAA8YMPP7HqI0JhMUNCAAAAAAAAAAAlAAAALAAAAAAAAAAICgAA3PEBANrwEQM48wEAyPARAwIATwC5h6_n","distance":24.235777,"name":"Crossway","location":[0.127452,51.507418]},{"hint":"nhVagLcVWoAaAAAAAAAAABoAAABoAAAAh-iQQQAAAAAuLpFBFG6QQhoAAAAAAAAAGgAAAGgAAAAICgAAV-QaACXNIANg2BwAOOAgAwEAPwG5h6_n","distance":8715.305307,"name":"Gas Works Road","location":[1.762391,52.481317]}]}



// if the extraction stage fails it might be because too little RAM is assigned to docker:
